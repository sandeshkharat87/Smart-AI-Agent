Smart Multi AI Agent : Code Review Agent

Developed a multi-agent AI system using LangGraph and the Ollama Gemma2b LLM model to understand and process natural language queries. This system leverages NLP techniques to convert human queries into structured, machine-interpretable questions. Subsequently, a code review agent analyzes the extracted code for correctness and potential issues. If the code passes the review, a code execution agent runs it locally and provides the output to the user
